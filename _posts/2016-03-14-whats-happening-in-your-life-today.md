If you listen to the pundits, you'll be going in the direction of the masses, always a bad omen for someone who wants a degree of self respect and also, wants to function with a cool head. I call this the helicopter mindset. Not too high to be irrelevant, not too low to be dopey. Just the right height to see with both eyes, and your heart, what's really going on?
